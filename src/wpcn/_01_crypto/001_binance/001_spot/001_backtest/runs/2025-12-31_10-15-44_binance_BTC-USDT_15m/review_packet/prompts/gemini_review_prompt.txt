You are a strict quant reviewer. Review this WPCN Spring/UTAD backtest run.
1) Check for lookahead/leakage risks (signals using future data, resampling errors).
2) Check whether entry/exit simulation is overly optimistic. Suggest conservative adjustments.
3) Identify overfitting signs in walk-forward and parameter stability.
4) Recommend next validation experiments and stress tests.
Return: bullet list with severity levels and concrete fixes.
